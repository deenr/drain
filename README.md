# Drain
This is an Android mobile application project developed in Java using Android Studio that helps users track their daily water intake. The app stores the user's data in Firebase and provides them with a history of their water intake over the last few days. The project was created for a university course called Web Development (3291) at the University of Hasselt.

### Description
Drain is an Android app that allows users to keep track of their daily water intake. The app prompts the user to enter their water intake for the day, and it stores that data in Firebase. The user can then view their daily water intake, as well as their intake history over the past few days.

The app features a user-friendly interface with a clean and minimalistic design. It includes easy-to-use navigation and input fields, as well as a graph to visualize the user's water intake history.

### Technologies Used
The Drain app was developed using the following technologies:

- Java programming language
- Android Studio IDE
- Firebase for storing user data
- [GraphView library](https://github.com/jjoe64/GraphView) for creating the water intake graph

### Installation and Usage
To run Drain, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Connect the project to your Firebase account.
4. Run the application on an Android device or emulator.

Once the app is running, the user can start tracking their water intake by entering the amount of water they have consumed for the day. The app will store this data in Firebase and display it on the app's main screen. The user can also view their water intake history by navigating to the history tab.
